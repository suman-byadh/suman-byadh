# Hey, I'm Suman 👋  

💡 **Learner | Fitness Enthusiast | Aspiring Developer | Discipline First**  

I’m on a journey of building myself both **physically and mentally**.  
Currently preparing for the **WB Police Constable exam (Nov 2025)** while also learning **Python, AI, and tech skills** to grow in the digital world.
